the infrastucre folder will contain the adapters that will be based on 
the interfaces created in the repository folder to connect the appliction
with external components, such as DB, email-services and so on.
the goal is to stablish a contract between our appliction and and other services
in case a replacement needs to happen in the future it'll be a matter to replace
the adapter only.
